# Questions

- Does the speed of the meteors correspond to the download / upload speed?
- Why download first?
- What do the second and third tab do?
- What does the forward button beside the server icon do?
- How is the server picked?
- How to fake the data
- What is the correct test length?
- Likeve only shows up on the result under telco company name

# Future Improvements

- In the summary screen comparing against previous tests / others
- light mode, iPad, and landscape support
- match fonts
- make tab bar icons bigger
- different highlights for indicating good scores versus poor
- adding a tail to the emitted values as they disappear
- make a smoother transition between the animations

# Concerns

- How would the test and summary graph handle a really bad speed test?
- For the speed test screen what would the result look like if the speeds were drastically different?
- On the x axis of the summary view graph there are no units
- On the summary screen what is the value to the right of Jitter and Loss. These seem like bugs as ping does not have a value.

# Not Implemented

- I like how the summary result screen takes up the whole view. I find it slightly simplifies the view and navigation away from it.

# To fix

- The lack of a naming convention used in the assets catalog
- Containing the upload animation to only the top part of the view.
- clean up the upload animation to make it more look like the spec
- clean up the upload animation code
- add a start animation that shows both colors like the spec.
- clean up warnings in xCode
- clean up folder structure

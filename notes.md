# Questions

- Does the speed of the meteors correspond to the download / upload speed?
- Why download first?
- What do the second and third tab do?
- What does the forward button beside the server icon do?
- How is the server picked?
- How to fake the data
- What is the correct test length?

# Future Improvements

- In the summary screen comparing against previous tests / others
- light mode, iPad, and landscape support
- match fonts
- make tab bar icons bigger
- different highlights for indicating good scores versus poor
- adding a tail to the emitted values as they disappear

# Concerns

- How would the test and summary graph handle a really bad speed test?
- For the speed test screen what would the result look like if the speeds were drastically different?

# Not Implemented

# To fix

- The lack of a naming convention used in the assets catalog
- Containing the upload animation to only the top part of the view.
